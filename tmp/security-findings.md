# Security Findings

## Summary of Review

A security review was conducted focusing on authentication, CSRF protection, environment variable handling, and interaction with the external WAHA API.

- **Environment Variables**: Environment variables are managed using `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` and `zod` for validation, which is a good practice. Secrets are intended to be stored in `.env` and not hardcoded.
- **Authentication**: Authentication is handled using NextAuth.js with the Prisma adapter and Credentials provider. Password hashing with bcrypt is used for signup. The implementation appears reasonably secure.
- **WAHA API Client**: The client correctly uses the API key from environment variables and interacts with the WAHA API over what is presumed to be HTTPS (via axios). Input handling largely relies on the WAHA API's security.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability: Insecure CSRF Token Verification

*   **ID**: CSRF-001
*   **Title**: Insecure CSRF Token Verification Implementation
*   **Severity**: High
*   **Location**: [`src/server/auth/csrfToken.ts:15`](src/server/auth/csrfToken.ts:15)
*   **Description**: The current implementation of `verifyCsrfToken` in `src/server/auth/csrfToken.ts` does not securely store and compare CSRF tokens server-side. It relies on passing an `expectedToken` which is explicitly stated as not secure. Additionally, a default `CSRF_SECRET` is used if the environment variable is not set, which is a security risk.
*   **Impact**: This vulnerability makes the application susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, where an attacker can trick a user into performing unwanted actions on the web application.
*   **Remediation**: Implement proper server-side storage of CSRF tokens, such as in user sessions. Modify `verifyCsrfToken` to retrieve the expected token from the server-side store and compare it with the submitted token using `timingSafeEqual`. Ensure a strong, unique `CSRF_SECRET` is always used in production environments and remove the default value.
*   **Verification**: After implementing the fix, perform manual and automated testing to confirm that CSRF attacks are prevented. This includes attempting to submit forms or perform actions without a valid CSRF token or with a manipulated token.

## Potential Areas for Further Review

- **WAHA API Security**: The security of the application is dependent on the security of the external WAHA API, particularly regarding input validation and handling. A security assessment of the WAHA API itself is recommended if possible.
- **Input Validation in API Routers**: While some input validation is present, a comprehensive review of all API router inputs is recommended to ensure all user-supplied data is properly validated and sanitized before use or passing to external services.
- **Error Message Verbosity**: Ensure that detailed error messages, especially those from external services like WAHA, do not expose sensitive information to users in a production environment.

## Next Steps

The primary next step is to address the High severity CSRF vulnerability by implementing proper server-side token storage and verification. Further security reviews could focus on the potential areas identified above.
